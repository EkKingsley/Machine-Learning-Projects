# Customer Segmentation Analysis of real world Retail Data.

- The use of RFM(Recency, Frequency, Monetary) with another customer scoring metric; Length of Relationship 
is used to score and assign loyalty levels to the data grouped by the customers who have made a tansaction with the retail store.
- The grouped data is then used to calculate the scoring metrics; Recency, Frequency, Moneytary and Length of Relationship.
- The metric scores are then all summed up as the Customer Score which is then used to assign loyalty levels from lowest to highest, 
namely Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum, in order to give labels to the values to make it easy to identify customers having high or low scores.
- An Unsupervised Machine Learning model, KMeans is then built on the scoring metrics Recency, Frequency, Moneytary and Length of Relationship and hence based on the 
metrics, the customers are grouped into 3 clusters according to similar they are as specified in the model.
